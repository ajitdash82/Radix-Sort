# Radix-Sort
Radix Sort Program in java to be implemented for numbers with unequal numbers of digits together

Generally Radix Sort method is implemented for the elements of equal numbers of digits. But here I have written the Radix SOrt program to be implemented numbers having any numbers of digits. Mean the program can be implemented for a range of numbers with one, two, three, four and five digits at once.
